## Ledger
Ledger contains all the transactions in a sequentially connected way. Every peer maintains this ledger. Once a transaction is committed to the ledger, it can not be modified (i.e. immutable) or tampered. All nodes in the network should agree on the same order of transactions in the ledger. Fabric uses Raft consensus algorithm to decide on transaction order.

## Smart Contract
Smart contract contains the business logic to manage assets in the blockchain ledger. Usually smart contract is used to create, read and update assets. In hyperledger Fabric, smart contracts are in packages in a network called chaincode.
